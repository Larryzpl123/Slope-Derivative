# Slope / Derivative Graphing Calculator for Polynomials
<br/>
A tool to graphicalize polynomials with thier 1st and 2nd derivatives, made with basic java without needing any special libraries to run.<br/>
<br/>
input format is y = n , or y=nx^3 +/- nx^2 +/- nx +/- n, or input without y. <br/>
examples will be y = 3, x = 3, y=3x, 3x^2, y = 4x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1.
